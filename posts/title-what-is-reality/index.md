# What Is Reality?

Reality—what is it, really? Is it the physical world around us? The sum of our perceptions? Or something deeper, beyond what we can observe? Philosophers, scientists, and mystics have pondered this question for centuries, yet the answer remains elusive.

## The Physical vs. Perceived Reality

One perspective sees reality as the objective world governed by natural laws. This is the universe as studied by science—atoms, forces, space, and time. However, our experience of reality is shaped by our senses, which can be deceived. Optical illusions, dreams, and even hallucinations challenge the idea that what we see is what truly exists.
